[Demo made in class: Basic Binding](https://github.com/AppDevIII-W24-Code/Demos/tree/632ce254f018c06db0b29a42a52228b7ad6d41a9/Demo3BasicBinding)

- In C#, data bindings allow properties of two objects to be coupled, i.e: to change together.

  - A change in one object causes a change in the other.

  - One is called the *source* and the other is the *target*.

  - Data Binding involves a *binding object* which transfers the data from source to target and/or vice versa.

  - The target property must be a `bindable` property: which means that the target object must derive from `BindableObject`.

  - The online `.NET MAUI` documentation indicates which properties are bindable properties.

    Example: A property of `Label` such as `Text` is associated with the bindable property `TextProperty` ([source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.maui.controls.label?view=net-maui-7.0)).

- `.NET MAUI` provides a markup extension to provide binding through `xaml`.

  - There are multiple ways to set the `BindingContext` of the target object. Sometimes itâ€™s set from the code-behind file, sometimes using a `StaticResource` or `x:Static` markup extension, and sometimes as the content of `BindingContext` property-element tags.

# XAML Markup extensions

This feature of XAML is useful to add functionality to the XAML page. For example using data binding  or using colors defined in a static dictionary. All Markup expression implement the `IMarkupExtension` interface so that they can be referenced by XAML. Think of them as pointers to new functionality. 

Markup Extensions appear as curly brackets in XAML, here are a few examples:

- You can use a string to define a color instead of having to set the `Color` attribute

  example:  `<Boder BackgroundColor="Red"/>` 

- You can use a static dictionary:

  example:  `"BackgroundColor = {StaticResource Secondary}"`

- You can use a data type using:

  example:  `{x:Type myDataType}`

- The following are the most comment markup expressions:

  - `AppThemeBinding`: refers to the current system theme

  - `Binding`: **The topic of this lecture!**

  - `DataTemplate`: A template object for multi-binding (see: [Example below](# Example of the `CollectionView`))

  - `DynamicResource`: A link to a dictionary key for styling values that may change at run time (for example in a game)

  - `StaticResource`: A link to a static dictionary with values that are static (ex: Theme colors)

  - `OnPlatform`: This helps you customize the UI based on the platform.

  - `x:Static` : referencing static fields, property or enums. 

  - `x:Reference`: referencing a named item on the same page (for which `x:Name` was set)

  - `x:Array`: declares an array of a given data type :

    ```xaml
    <x:Array Type ="{x:Type x:Int16}">
        <x:Int16>1</x:Int16>
        <x:Int16>2</x:Int16>
        <x:Int16>3</x:Int16>
        <x:Int16>4</x:Int16>
    </x:Array>
    ```

  - `x:Type`: refers to a data type object in `System.Type` (note you must include the `System.Type` namespace to find the usual data types)

  - `x:Null`: null value for XAML properties.

    

# Visual element to Visual element

Bindable attributes of a visual element can be bound to other attributes from the same Content Page. Bindings can be set on any class that derives from `BindableObject`

**How does it work?**

- Use of the Markup extension `{Binding ...}`
- You may either use the `BindingContext` to set the source
- You may alternatively specify the `Source` directly in the Target and use the `Path` to bind to a particular property.
- Refer to the following example:

```xaml
<Slider x:Name="slider"
        Maximum="360"
        VerticalOptions="Center" />
<Label Text="{Binding Source={x:Reference slider}, Path=Value}"/>
```

Refer to the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/data-binding/basic-bindings) from more information.

**Binding Modes**

- A single view (page) can have data bindings on several of its properties. However, each view can have only one `BindingContext`, so multiple data bindings on that view must all reference properties of the same object.

- Each property has a different relation with the UI element it is bound to. The `Mode`

  property of `Binding`, which is set to a member of the `BindingMode` enumeration and can have one of the following values:

  - `Default` - depends on the UI item being bound, usually `TwoWay`
  - `OneWay` values are transferred from the source to the target.
  - `OneWayToSource` values are transferred from the target to the source.
  - `TwoWay` values are transferred both ways between source and target.
  - `OneTime` data goes from source to target, but only when the `BindingContext` changes.

**String formatting**

You may bind values to the Text property of a UI element such as a `Label` while keeping a specific format, for example: if you wish to represent a date as such: *"Today: October 23, 2023"*



```xaml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             xmlns:sys="clr-namespace:System;assembly=netstandard"
             x:Class="DataBindingDemos.StringFormattingPage"
             Title="String Formatting">
    <VerticalStackLayout BindingContext="{x:Static sys:DateTime.Now}">
        <Label Text="{Binding StringFormat='Today: {0:MMMM dd, yyyy}'}" />
    </VerticalStackLayout>
</ContentPage>
```

Here are a few useful string formattings:

- `{0:F2}` : Two digits after the decimal 
- `{0:F0}` : Only the integer part
- `{0:MMMM}`: Month, January, February, ...
- `&quot;`: double quotations
- `{{}}`: to display curly brackets 



For more complex translations of the bound values, use [Converters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/maui/converters/).





# Visual element to C# Property

To create a binding between the XAML and the code behind of a Page, you simply need to specify the `BindingContext` inside the constructor of the `ContentPage`.

Let's use the example of the `PostPage` from Lab1. In this page we have hardcoded the image path within the `XAML`code to create the layout of a post. 

We could create a public property in the code behind to bind the image source:

`PostPage.xaml.cs`:

```c#
namespace Lab1.Views
{
    public ImageSource PostImg { get; set; } = ImageSource.FromFile("fall.jpg"); //Added
    public partial class PostPage : ContentPage
    {
            public PostPage()
            {
                InitializeComponent();
                BindingContext = this; // Added
            }
    }
}
```

`PostPage.xaml`:

```xaml
    <ScrollView>
        <VerticalStackLayout Padding="10" Spacing="5" VerticalOptions="Center">
            <!-- content...-->
            <Border BackgroundColor="Black" Padding="5">
                <Image Source="{Binding PostImg}"  Aspect="AspectFit" MaximumHeightRequest="500"/>
            </Border>
            <!-- content...-->
            
        </VerticalStackLayout> 
    </ScrollView>
```





**Question:** Why did I use an ImageSource and not a string? Test it out with the `dotnet_bot_jetpack` image on the same page and explain why isn't it working with strings?



**Challenge #1;** Use binding to properties to replace the hardcoded `dotnet_bot_jetpack` source image and the `.NET Bot` label.

**Challenge #2: **Try using binding by making the `LikesCount` a public property and bind it to XAML using String formatting.



> You might wonder, what have we gained by using binding in those example? 
>
> Not much for now, but as we make the `PostPage` more dynamic, having access to the variable properties in the code behind will make our lives much easier later on.



### `INotifyPropertyChanged`

As per Microsoft [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/data/how-to-implement-property-change-notification?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8), to notify the UI that a property has been updated dynamically, the following has to be applied to the model class:

- The UI elements should use `Binding` to connect to the properties in the class.
  - A property requires a getter to provide a value to the UI element.
  - A property requires a setter to send a value from the UI to the class.
- The class with bound properties must implement `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface.
- Declare an event `public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;` .
- The property must be a full property with a private backing field and a full setter and getter.
- Create the `OnPropertyChanged` method to raise the event. (code provided in the documentation above).
- Finally, `OnPropertyChanged();` should be called in the setter of the property that is required to update the UI.
- Each property that is required to change a UI value should follow the process.

> Check this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.inotifypropertychanged?view=net-7.0) for more details in `.NET MAUI`.



In the .NET MAUI framework, you will realize that the `ViewModel` is nothing more but a class that implements this interface and that has a few public properties bound to the views and that fire the `OnPropertyChanged`event every time the model or the view were changed.



## Example of the `CollectionView`

[Here is my solution](https://github.com/AppDevIII-W24-Code/Demos/tree/632ce254f018c06db0b29a42a52228b7ad6d41a9/DemoSocialMediaBinding)

Let's make the comment list in the Lab1 more dynamic using binding.

### Defining a CollectionView in the PostPage.

#### ItemSource



```xaml
<CollectionView.ItemsSource>
    <x:Array Type ="{x:Type x:String}">
        <x:String>Cool! Nice pic</x:String>
        <x:String>amazing!</x:String>
        <x:String>I love it</x:String>
        <x:String>Cool! The colors are so bright!</x:String>
    </x:Array>
</CollectionView.ItemsSource>
```

Alternatively, the data structure can be defined in the code behind as a public property:

```csharp
public partial class CommentPage : ContentPage
{
    private List<string> _comments = new List<string>() { "Cool! Nice pic", "amazing!", "Trop beau!!", "I love it", "Cool! The colors are so bright!" };
    public List<string> Comments { get { return _comments; } }
    public CommentPage()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        BindingContext = this;
    }
}
```

By setting the `BindingContext = this`, the XAML `ContentPage` can now access public properties of the associated code behind class. Note: You must remove the `<CollectionView.ItemsSource> ....` from the code behind to avoid setting it twice.

```csharp
<CollectionView AbsoluteLayout.LayoutBounds="0.5,0.35,1,0.80" AbsoluteLayout.LayoutFlags="All" ItemsSource="{Binding Comments}">
```



We may eventually define a model class to include all the properties of a comment:

```csharp
public class Comment
{
    public int UserId { get; set; }
    public Uri ProfilePic { get; set; }
    public string Text {  get; set; }
}
```



We can then use a `List<Comment>` in the `CommentPage` code behind as such:



#### ItemTemplate

The item template define how each child item in the collection view should be displayed and how this 



```xaml
<CollectionView.ItemTemplate>
    <DataTemplate>
        <HorizontalStackLayout>
            <Image Source="{Binding ProfilePic}" WidthRequest="35"/>
            <Border BackgroundColor="LightGray" StrokeShape="RoundRectangle 10,10,10,10" Padding="5">
                <Label Text="{Binding Text}"/>
            </Border>
        </HorizontalStackLayout>
    </DataTemplate>
</CollectionView.ItemTemplate>
```



### Adding Items to the Collection View: 

Let's try to add comments by reading the text input from the `Entry` when the send `ImageButton` is clicked.

1. In your code behind add private attributes representing the current user's Id and User profile pic, this is the profile pic used for posting new comments:

   ```csharp
   private int userId_ = 456;
   private string userProfilePic_ = "<add a url to pic of your choice>";
   ```

   

2. Modify the `Entry`in the `CommentPage`so that it has a `x:Name` property:

   ```xaml
   <Entry x:Name="CommentsEntry" Placeholder="Add a comment..." <!-- ...etc... --->
   ```

3. Add an event Handler on your `ImageButton` and rename it accordingly

   ```csharp
   private void Btn_Send_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
   {
   	string comment = CommentEntry.Text;
   	if(comment !=null)
   	{
   		Comments.Add(new Comment(){UserId= userId_, Text=comment,ProfilePic = new Uri(userProfilePic_)});
   		CommentEntry.Text="";
   	}
   }
   ```

4. What do you observe? Why is the comment not added?

   Answer: The List is a data structure that does not notify its subscribers of any new added item. To solve this you can either:

   call the `OnPropertyChanged` event or you can use an `ObservableCollection`

#### What is an `ObservableCollection`?

As the list of comments is modified, we need to have a mechanism to notify the `CollectionView` that the data structure was changed, you may use an `ObservableCollection<Comment>` instead on `List<Comment>` which is a data collection that implements the `INotifyPropertyChanged`. We will see more on this in future lectures.



### Challenge 1 (Easy): Adding Comments in the `PostPage` 

Try to add a similar comments section in the `PostPage`. 

### Challenge 2 (Medium): Avoid overwriting the comments when the `CommentPage` is pushed. 

How can we make the comments list shared across both pages and how can we make sure the comments added in the `CommentPage` won't be lost once you navigate out and into the page.

> Hint: There are two possible solutions: 1) create a static data repo that will make it accessible throughout the views (this is the easiest option for now), 2) dependency injection : pass the comment list by reference to the constructor of the `CommentPage`

### Challenge 3 (Hard): Creating a Post model

1. Create a `Post` model which will save the following information:

   `Post`

   - `string UserId`
   - `string` Username 
   - `Uri ProfileImage`
   - `Uri ContentImage`
   - `ObservableCollection<Comment> Comments`
   - `int Likes`

2. Instantiate a `Post` in your code behind with a list of `Comments`

3. Set the `Comments = DataRepos.SocialMediaPosts[0].Comments`

4. Create a public property for the `ContentImage` 

5. Set it to `DataRepos.SocialMediaPosts[0].ProfileImage`. 

6. Bind the `ContentImage` to the Image behind displayed.

7. Bind the `Likes` to the `LikesLabel` in the code behind.

   > Hint: You might need to change the `Post` class to make it notify the UI of any change.

### Challenge 4 (Medium): Swipe through posts

1. Add a `Data Repos` folder and add a `Posts` class

2. Modify the `Posts` class to make it static 
3. Add a static property`ObservableCollection<Post> SocialMediaPosts`
4. Add posts and comments to every post.

> Hint: You can use a `CarouselView` or simply add left/right `ImageButton`
