## Development process

- Cross-Platform App Development `CPAD`
- Use programming languages that are not native to the mobile OS. 
- The programming language itself is cross-platform.
- Includes multiple SDKs for the various platforms.

### Drawbacks of using CPAD

- Performance
  - Even though CPAD frameworks claim to have a performance matching a native app, native apps tend to perform faster. 
  - Users will *NOT* notice the difference in most cases.
- App size
  - Native apps tend to have a smaller size after compilation.
  - Apps created using CPAD will be larger in size due to the fact that additional elements are added during the converting process.
- Constant Updating
  - When Google or Apple issue an update, an additional feature or a new API, CPAD frameworks must implement them and in a timely manner. 

## Popular Cross-platform Frameworks

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/cpad/Cordova.png" width="50%" />

- Opensource `Hybrid` app development framework by Apache.
  - Single codebase that generates native Android and iOS apps.
- Languages used: 
  - JavaScript
  - UI: HTML5 & CSS3 for UI.
- Command line based: 
  - No IDE: web component built using the developerâ€™s editor of choice. 
- Process:
  - Build web application. 
  - Cordova converts web app into native app. 
  - Cordova provides a large set of plugins to access native capabilities via JavaScript. 
- Excellent when a web app already exists and needs to be converted it into an app.
