### Team Contract

Each group must submit an informal team contract. One contract is submitted for the whole team and should be made available in the team‚Äôs GitHub repository for the project **as a markdown file**.

A contract template is included in the GitHub classroom repository for this project and is also available [here](./TeamContractTemplate).

### Epic User Stories

Below are four [Epic User Stories](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/epic/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'epic)) that should be fulfilled by the end of the project. The epic user stories should guide the creation of **smaller and more specific** user stories for milestone 1 (see next section).

**Farm technician**

1. As the farm technician, I want to know the environmental conditions inside the container in near real-time so that I can make necessary adjustments.

1. As the farm technician, I need to be able to control the environmental conditions inside the container to make sure that plants are healthy.

**Fleet Owner**

1. As the fleet inverter / owner, I want to know the location and placement of the container farms so that I can track company assets.

1. As the fleet owner, I want to be informed of security issues inside the container farm so that I can mobilize an appropriate response.

### Creating of User stories

The project must be organized and managed using the Scrum methodology. Each team is required to define the user stories that they will implement in the course of the project.

The user stories should:

- Be derived from one of the epic user stories described in the previous section.

- Include an Acceptance Criteria section that involves specific hardware requirements (see section [Subsystems & Hardware](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r5b5m1fvmDRZswrYxSoVx0ezlDFAbBRMkoZBTXbzJ6Y/edit#heading=h.8ny33raoupe0)).

- Follow the standard:

  *‚ÄúAs a ‚Ä¶, I want to ‚Ä¶, so that ‚Ä¶ .‚Äù*

- Be small and testable.

- Be independent of other user stories (where possible).

Clarification questions regarding system users should be asked in the Teams for the project. The user descriptions will be further detailed if necessary, according to questions received in Teams.

### Project Tracking

Each team should organize and track their work using [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).

At the end of each sprint and deliverable presentation, the team will show their backlog, boards and task assignment.
